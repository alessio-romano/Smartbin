# Smartbin
SmartBin - a smart solution for garbage management.\
This IoT project was made at the University of Pisa with my working group. Its purpose is to propose a smart solution for garbage management as explained in its own website.
A demo of the project prototype, made with the help of a 3D printer can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqB3y-n9yO0
